In this code, we are able to:
1. pre-process (normalization, baseline substraction) the FTIR spectra and save it as .CSV files for further plot
2. perform an exploratory analysis of the data by making a hierarchical clustering of the FTIR spectra. Obtaining the dendrogram and heatmap of the loads involved
3. apply dimensionality reduction techniques as PCA and PLS
4. fit_train_test 4 classification models over the reduced data of the FTIR spectra through a pipeline
5. Make predictions of unseen FTIR spectra
